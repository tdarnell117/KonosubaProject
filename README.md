This was a Passion Project for me. I am a huge lover of anime and after seeing the most recent anime movie for Konosuba, I decided to make a fan page for their new movie.

You can checkout your favorite characters, the synopsis, see the manga they have, and checkout the home page trailer to get excited for the new movie!

This project is using most react abilities from redux to react life cycle hooks and all dynamic content with a 3rd party api as well.
